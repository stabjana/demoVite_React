## React Wednesday

We are creating a hr app

### connecting it with github

- npm create bla ordnerstruktur erstellen,
- aufrüumen
- dann github repo für projekt erstellen
- dann:
- im lokalen ordner, den man mit npm create bla erstellt hat:
- git init
- git add .
- git commit -m "cleaning up the file and initialize"
- git remote add origin https://github.com/stabjana/hr-app.git
- git push origin main

## organise the folder

2 new components in new folder called components
simple css for both of them
card = cards card.css
employee should look like empl.css

use multiple empl cards from the list
just call the card with a dummy text

employees list is called from the app

card is in the list
app is collectin of all the pieces

## code style

- code design
- helps to prevent merge conflicts

## what is ES Lint

- helps with syntax
- makes the code smoother
- prevents bugs

es lint is checking for syntax errors and its already implemented in vite

we need to set more rules from **ES lint configuration**
eslint.config.js

shift command p
format
JS formatter

shift command p
format document (forced)
JS formatter

### 3rd step

add props to the Employee card
name role department nocheins nocheins

pass props to cards in employee list

add state to card
use state within emplcard to manage the role initializing it with the role passed in as a prop
there is a button to promote them to team lead

### Handling Events

if you want anything you need an event
same events like in JS

onclick here.

we dont need eventListeners

what element is doing what and when.

#### step 4

if role is team leader change it to original role
if role is not tem leader
with if statements

#### step 5

update Readme with overview of the app
list core features descriptions
include a simple usage guide
reflect on what you have practiced
push your today's work to github
