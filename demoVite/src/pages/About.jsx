                In this project, we’re focusing on the basics of React. We’ll practice
                using components, state, props, conditional rendering, and routing. The
                goal is to build a strong foundation in React by creating simple,
                real-world examples. This way, you'll feel confident using React to
                build dynamic and responsive web applications.
