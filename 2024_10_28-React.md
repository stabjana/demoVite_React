## React Monday

Vite as basic application. makes the main setup

npm run “dev”

```js
 "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "vite build",
    "lint": "eslint .",
    "preview": "vite preview"}
```

devDependencies (in package json)
packages needed for the development server
only when working with the code

SPA - only one HTML ist hier
danach wird alles in das div mit der id=root gepackt
Rest wird mit JS gemacht

## what is a component?

a piece of code, that serves one task
and carries a function that does one thing
stored in one file
is connected with other files
creating html elements

how can we create components?
class components can render

render is in the main, it shows the stuff in the browser

does read only on the page load
if anything changes in the component: re-render it

## what is prop?

props = parameter that is taken in by a component

to pass data from parent element to child element

creating own attributes

the way to pass data to the component

send data to the component and it is sent by attributes

## what is export and import?

export default will export one thing (single main component from the file)
import Whatever from ‘./Card’ (because its default)

<Whatever firstName=“Margit” title=“CEO” age=“29” />

jsx has emmet in it - if only js: it doenst know the emmet

## named exports

```js
export function Box() {
return <div>I*m a Box!</div>;
}

export function Circle() {
return <div>I*m a Circle!</div>;
}

-> export und declaration in one line

import {  Box, Circle } from ‘./Box’;
```

if its named, then it needs to be in curly brackets
and it has to be the same name as in the function

(otherwise it can be named whatever you want)

Mixed import works as well

```js
import DefaultCompinent, { Box, Circle };
```

Default: one main component per file
Named: file with multiple exports

Props are read only

## State

what is the state of the element when coming in
= Object (contains the data of a component)

react will watch it all the time
if the data changes, it will re-render

allows to remember data between renders
need original and new state to know if there is a change
counter. 0;
counter: 1;

oh it was 0, now its not 0 anymore…
what was it in the beginning?
because it was overwritten,
so we need the state.
(it aims to the current state)

explain class Counter extends Component again…

its part of the components

```js
import React, { Component } from "react"; // has to be exactly the same name as the component
// what wo import: READ THE MANUAL!

class Counter extends Component {
  // Counter is YOURcomponent name
  // initialize state
  state = {
    // what state it starts with
    count: 0,
  };

  render() {
    // this specific component state, div is the lement, in p is the attribute
    return (
      <div>
        <p> Name: {this.props.name}</p>
        <p> Count: {this.state.count}</p>
      </div>
    ); // state count is 0 ->
  }
}
export default Counter; // import Counter from file Bla, dann zum import
```

State is an Object, it is inside a component

## Hooks

special functions that gives functional components the POWER OF CLASS COMPONENTS

## States in functions

with Hooks useState you can write states in functions

**pure functions** vs **functions with side effects**
(all the things the function needs to do to return = side effects)
console.log() -> with side effects

need Hooks definetly for fetching

```js
useState();
useEffect();
```

### Hook rules

- prefix: use
- must be called at the top lvl of a component
  - can't be called in if statements or loops or nested functions (conditional statements)
- must be called from a React function (inside a React component or another hook) [not by vanilla JS]

## useState

```js
import { useState } from "react";

function Person() {
  // component name, function component (looks like destructuring but isnt)
  const [person, setPerson] = useState({ id: 1, name: "Margit" }); // variable name: Person | 2nd: is the method name
  // const [variable, method] = useState();
  const [age, setAge] = useState(29); // useState is by default 29 ->
  // here can be a lot of code
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Person Details</h2>
      <p>ID: {person.id}</p>
      <p>Name: {person.name}</p>
      <p>Age: {age}</p>
    </div>
  ); // person is an object because we declare it in line 177: const [person, setPerson] = useState({ id ... bla bla
}

export default Person;
```

WHAT DID WE DO IN THE MORNING?
GO THROUGH THE CODE AND MAKE IT WORK
